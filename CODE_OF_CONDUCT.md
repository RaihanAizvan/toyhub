We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone involved in the ToyHub project. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all contributors, maintainers, and users to help us create a positive and constructive environment by respecting each other and working together for the betterment of the project.

## Our Standards

We expect the following behaviors from everyone participating in the ToyHub project:

### Be Respectful

Treat others with kindness and respect. Disagreements are natural, but they should never lead to personal attacks. Focus on ideas rather than individuals.

### Be Inclusive

We welcome contributions from everyone, regardless of experience level, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

### Be Collaborative

Collaboration is essential to the success of the ToyHub project. Be open to constructive feedback, be willing to help others, and seek assistance when needed. Share knowledge and expertise to help the community grow.

### Be Mindful of Your Words

Use welcoming and inclusive language. Avoid language that could be considered offensive, discriminatory, or harmful. Remember that your words can have a significant impact on others.

### Accept Constructive Criticism

Feedback is an important part of the development process. Accept and provide feedback in a constructive manner. Be open to suggestions and improvements.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable in the ToyHub project:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form.
- Personal attacks, insults, or derogatory comments.
- Inappropriate or unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, inflammatory remarks, or disruptive behavior.
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission.
- Any other behavior that is not aligned with our values of respect, inclusivity, and collaboration.

## Reporting and Enforcement

If you witness or experience unacceptable behavior, please report it as soon as possible to the project maintainers at [aizvanr@gmail.com]. All reports will be reviewed and investigated, and appropriate action will be taken in response to any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct.

The project maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject any contributions that do not comply with this Code of Conduct. They may also take further action, including temporary or permanent bans from the community, depending on the severity of the violation.
